Lenny Kravitz was the first black rock star I ever knew about; I heard him before I heard Hendrix, whom he is often compared to. I had never seen anyone who looked quite like him play like that. 
17883575980977998
In a nostalgic  mood...

One of my favorite takes on "Amazing Grace".
17905365487657943
In honor of Beau Biden and his father, our 46th president! 
17893001134842568
Actually meant to grab a different album (Was looking for Take Me To The River) But this works too! Apparently it's inspired by "blissed out hippie chicks", LSD, and Yoo-Hoo chocolate soda. 
18132927322155980
What happens when you blow your record budget on one song. Not one album, (which you already have), but one SONG!Great song, though!  Right?
17896945264781606
Passed on this years ago and haven't seen it in vinyl since then so I had to pick it up..
18135121219148309
This one seemed appropriate somehow to me. Your mileage may vary! 
17894942689754854
Picked this up this weekend. I didn't even know it was ever released on vinyl.
17890055086890468
Tried to come up with the one perfect track for today.. Think I nailed it...One of my daughter's favorite songs. What can I say? Kid's smart.
17863767335298521
No politics today, just something quietly beautiful.

I couldn't find "Ding dong, the (M)itch is dead" so this will have to do.

Surprise score in the bins this weekend. An old copy of Sarah Vaughan covering some classic Brazilian composers (Nascimento,  Jobim, Deodato, Valle...) she brings such a different feel to them - I'm used to hearing vocalists with very high voicing (think Astrid Gilberto) so this is pretty cool!
18065909011250897
Remember I mentioned Rod Stewart had stolen a Jorge Ben song? I finally found a copy of the 1972 original. Stewart was on vacation at Carnival and must have heard this in the streets. He later copped to the accidental theft and he and Ben agreed to donate all the royalties to UNICEF. It ended up as one of the biggest hits of his career.
17907527062603574
With traditional classics such as "Back Door Santa", "Santa Baby", and "Christmas In Hollis", and a Keith Haring cover, if you HAVE to have a Christmas album, this is a good one!
18185065012041195
I don't normally buy new albums completely unheard (they are so expensive! ), but this collaboration had such great people on it I couldn't resist.  Big disappointment,  but I knew it was a risk.  It just never goes anywhere...it's like a jam session where no one has any energy or ideas to propel it to the next level and it just lies there.  It's not bad, it's worse, boring. That's ok, I'll just listen to the Cowboy Bebop some more!
17909541295571223
"See you Space Cowboy"

I've always maintained that Rapture was one of the earliest rap songs to chart.
17911949446554463
Back in the Long Ago, Sinead O'Connor said that to understand her song "Mandinka" you had to read Alex Haley's opus "Roots". To which I thought, "What?!" The best I can figure is that she felt the industry was trying to trap and exploit her and she was resisting. That, or she was just another crazy 20yr old white girl. 
18125863153153012
A nice collection of hits by Jorge Ben, except for the one Rod Stewart stole from him. I'll have to track that one down someday. In the meantime...
17912735005549920
I always liked this album as it was really un-Madonna. A little electronic. A little house. Kinda funky in it's own way. Strange cowboy theme throughout, never understood that. And the videos were just plain weird. But it caught my eye this morning, so there you go. 
17928118156448358
For Record Store Day they often release early or alternative takes of tracks. I know it's a scam, but I fall for it anyway.  Every now and then there is a gem like this early take of Stevie Nicks' "Landslide". It's not hugely different,  but it does have a more intimate,  raw nature, than the version that made it to the original album.
17853045035388048
Found this in the crates this weekend. Merry Clayton.  A little known gospel singer, she did the backing vocals for one or two songs by some English band. 
17924521039471401
Morning filled with named entity extraction and LSTMs and RNNs and GRUs, my brain is already fried. So maybe a bit of sugary pop for Friday is called for. (Even the album looks like candy!)
Processing...
17968649215340669
This album was so big, and "Hello" of course went #1, but the track that grabs me most was one I'd never actually heard until I played the album. I remember I was in the kitchen cooking and I stopped, went to the turntable and restarted it and just sat there mesmerized. Even now when I hear it I have to stop whatever I'm doing and just listen.
17868539471156040
A little downtempo for the afternoon. 
18060111025259400
In another life, one in which I was actually musically literate,  I'd want to be Herbie Hancock. Not Miles, or Sly, or Prince or even Quincy (ok, maybe Q ). Herbie is a unicorn; a virtuoso talent, a creative genius, and cool as fuck.  The opening line to "Chameleon" is better known than Lincoln's Address, and infinitely funkier. 
17905766542569792
Mariah Carey is re-releasing just about all her albums - 16! And of course her Christmas album is at the top again this season. All this made me think of that other diva, Whitney. And then I wondered if they ever did a duet together. (Rumor always was they had beef.) Turns out they did - once. And it won a freaking Oscar! Then it occurred to me: I  actually have that album! In my defense it's a double LP and I hadn't gotten around to hearing all of it. Besides, I know more than a couple of women with shoes in their closet they haven't worn yet! 
17881401145948768
Some songs just cry out for vinyl and a decent system pushed just a bit. 
17872770365091905
Thinking of Chet Baker earlier, this is his last recording (he died two weeks later.) This one album tells such an amazing story. In his career, Baker went from a gorgeous, talented young man with a limitless future to being broke, strung out and having most of his teeth broken by drug dealers, to relearning how to play again and coming back once more to play like the genius he was. The first few bars of "My Funny Valentine" will break your heart; I challenge you to get through it without tearing up. 
17896698922689745
Still not awake this morning so I'm easing into the day. Even though I grew up hearing jazz, I didn't GET it. Still don't really, but I'm working on it. Bill Evans is someone I've been listening to a lot lately and shit like this just kills me: an entire studio album recorded in 1968 and never released till now. Anyway, his take on My Funny Valentine reminds me of Chet Baker...it's poignant in a mature way, not teen saccharine like a Michael Bible (sorry, too much Christmas music!) 
17934547129438230
I admit I was a bit dubious about this young French woman doing a song in tribute of Miriam Makeba, but the video sold me. 
17922662272482069
Kickin' off the week...(Hey, you gotta grab the low hanging fruit!). For a one-hit wonder the album is actually pretty good. I think they wrote "Pumped up Kicks" first, and the album around it. These days you needn't bother. 
17861651132224645
Sheryl Crow's final album. She says she will continue to make music but won't produce full albums any more. She suggests that people don't listen to them as "full artistic efforts", and I have to agree.  One of the attractions that vinyl has for me is that it forces you to interact with the music differently.  And it annoys me when  musicians put out something on vinyl just to capitalize on a fad but make no attempt to have the album be a coherent work.On Gil Scott-Heron's final album he laid down the law:"There is a proper procedure for taking advantage of any investment. Music, for example. Buying a CD is an investment. To get the maximum you mustLISTEN TO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME UNDER OPTIMUM CONDITIONSNot in your car or on a portable player through a headset.Take it home.Get rid of all distractions, (even her or him).Turn off your cell phoneTurn off everything that rings or beeps or rattles or whistles.Make yourself comfortableLISTEN all the way through.Think about what you gotThink about who would appreciate this investment.Decide if there is someone to share this with.Turn it on again.Enjoy Yourself."-Gil Scott-Heron
17905744120580346
First off, River is a Christmas song the same way Die Hard is a Christmas movie. Still, I need a new copy.  Blue was released in '71 and I swear this beat to death one  is close to that old. They recently released a remastered version which I finally decided to pickup only to find they stopped producing it to promote some fancy multi disc set they are putting out just as soon as she dies. Ok, I added that last part, but I wouldn't put it past the bastards.I complain about my collection wearing out but the truth is disc's like this one are FIFTY YEARS OLD! What else are we spending money on these days that will last that long? A buddy of mine got a new hip recently and they told him he'd need to replace it in 20 years. 20 years!? 
17862212093207386
Speaking of waiting, it's almost 2 minutes in before there are any vocals. (And even then, I swear it sounds like they screw up the first chorus! ) One of my favorite songs! 
17858198954293666
These boys' reaction when the drums come in is what I secretly hope for whenever I play something "from the day" for my daughter.  See? Your old man was cool once too! But on a darker note, it speaks to our society: you can't have a hit now where the "reward" doesn't show up till halfway through the song. You simply can't hold anyone's attention for that long. 
17878144459982687
I never knew there were lyrics to this until I saw The Sound Of Music! I'll stick with Coltrane! 
17884863916838043
You know how you get some of your friends together to jam in the garage? Well this is exactly like that, except your friends  are genius bluegrass musicians,  the garage is James Taylor's barn, and your name is Yo-yo Ma.

Alanis has a Record Store Day special release of her performing Jagged Little Pill live in London this year. I didn't pick it up (have to budget and RSD is dangerous! ) Besides, I have a mint copy of the original anyway. But I didn't realize it was all ACOUSTIC and after listening to a few of the tracks I have to say that for 2020 her doing 25yrs in with the guitar and the relaxed almost anguished pacing is kinda compelling so I may have to splurge
18115677094196619
Dug this out for the holidays. Not traditional but seems very 2020 to me. William DeVaughn via Massive Attack. 
18145554571100949
Starting off the season! Original from 1968! 
17861076650234021
Tried to explain to my daughter that her generation's "I Can't Feel My Face" is my "Cocaine". She asked who Eric Clapton was, to which I noted 3x inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, to which she said "Wah?". Sigh. 
17886195454796526
I suppose if you are a conga player fronting a band you have to not only be talented but generous, which goes a ways to explain why the minute and a half solo that starts the title track is given to the pianist.
17906162725565590
Some old school house to start the day. The last (sniff) album from Everything But The Girl and a bitch to find on vinyl!
17864193584153844
They are still waiting for that guitar to come back down. 
17865147830130392
Back when my daughter was studying the viola I introduced her to Lindsey Stirling. Of course she's long forgotten that and insists I could never be cool enough to have heard of her...so of course I had to break this out. 
17912583664524136
I confess I'd never heard of Santa Esmeralda, certainly not their version of Nina Simone's "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. I remember Costello and of course, The Animals, but after Kill Bill theirs is the only version I can imagine. 
17894374969688950
It's 1969, and Bill Graham is asked to help produce this music festival in NY. As part of the deal he insists that this new band he is managing be included. No one outside of San Francisco knew who they were, but whatever. Sure. Santana got paid $1,500 for the gig. This is the live recording of their performance.

Now something completely different...I've got several different takes on Porgy & Bess...from Leontyne Price's masterful recording, to that disappointing soundtrack with Poitier, and even Miles Davis' effort with Gil Evans. I've always struggled with this work being a Black story told through white eyes. But this version, with Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong is a different beast altogether. "Summertime", as originally written, is supposed to be a lullaby, but here it's a proclamation. "This? This is ours." 
18087047401211453
Fading...need something to pick me up.

Another joint I grew up listening to. Originally by Chano Pozo  and Dizzy Gillespie, here it is Tjader on vibes and Bobo (a Chano protege) on percussion.

I read somewhere that Sheeran taught himself to play the violin for this song in one evening. We've been in a pandemic for months and I can't even play the scales on my piano. 
17909257546531085
It's that kind of morning. I think I have seven different covers of The Mamas and The Papas' "California Dreamin'" but this one has all the feels. 
17906593873530490
One of the coolest aspects of collecting vinyl is the art. Usually the cover is interesting,  sometimes it's a gatefold, and occasionally you'll get liners with lyrics and pics. All I can say about Macklemore's "The Heist" is they must have been seriously proud of this release. It's a 2 album set in a box covered in fake alligator with gold gilt. Inside there are 20 separate full size paintings/photos, one for each track! 
17931880741434939
Some Nuyorican jazz. Including a screaming cover of Ellington and Tizol's Caravan.

Original Japanese pressing. The Japanese market for vinyl is so much more particular than the American market. So if you have a choice grab the Japanese copy. Here is Tori Kelly singing the hell out of my favorite track from the album:

Rolling Stone lists it as the greatest album of all time. It is, sadly, just as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. 
17878365010919821
This is a fun album  with some rare versions like an early take of "Edge of Seventeen." Destiny's Child"s "Bootylicious" is basically an extended sample of Stevie's guitar riff from the song and if you watch closely at the beginning of their video for it  Stevie actually has a cameo... 
17887900069755700
I'm only pretending to be able to study today so I'm giving up early. But I'm going out with this...Joni Mitchell's first known recording. She was 19 and still Joni Anderson and this was her first demo tape. Enjoy! (And Joni's Canadian so she has an excuse! If you can and haven't, there is still time to vote!) 
18138864916117041
Picked this up last time I was in New Orleans. Preservation Hall went to Cuba to trace their roots. Build bridges, not walls.  And remember,  Keep Your Head Up! 
17871892241044221
Peter Gabriel's "Scratch My Back, And I'll Scratch Yours." He covered a dozen songs that he loved and invited the artists to reciprocate by covering some of his material. Interesting idea, but it didn't really go over. Except for one track. His cover of Bowie/Eno's "Heroes". Absolutely fucking devastating.

I like exactly ONE song on this album, but it doesn't appear on vinyl anywhere else. 😡

For Record Store Day I picked up the Beastie Boys album that was released along with their movie this year. Nothing new, but it is a great greatest hits. It also includes Sabotage, which they licensed to the Biden campaign, something they have NEVER done with their music. 
18038839237301381
Side effect of actually LISTENING to the vinyl you collect is that it wears out. JT's greatest hits was recently remastered so I replaced the shitty copy that I'd purchased years ago to replace the even more shitty copy I had before that.
17858203895204516
The 60s were something weren't they? Original 1960 copy on red clear vinyl. It's got three of the greatest Latin Jazz percussionists on the same album: Tjader, Mongo, and Bobo. And that cover! What more could you ask for? Well, it's been recently remastered on 180gr but that just seems greedy. 
17871769208012448

I'm not sure about the previously unreleased music coming out of Prince's vault. On the one hand, if he'd wanted it out there he would have done it himself. On the other hand, some of it is simply bloody brilliant.  This is a collection of demo songs he wrote for other artists. We all know about Jungle Love and Nothing Compares 2 You, but did you know he wrote Manic Monday for the Bangles too?

I don't care what anyone says; this is one of the greatest albums ever produced.  Dusty's Son of A Preacher Man, and Just a Little Loving are definitive.

Ten years ago we lost Gil. After a decade  of drug related health issues (and drug related time in Rikers) he'd  just completed his last album, I'm New Here, the year before. This album is a "reimagining" of that masterpiece and pretty much perfect for our times.

Kruder & Dorfmeister? Sounds like an animated show about a chicken supervillian and his sidekick. At times brilliant,  but too damn long at 4(!) LPs. I always feel like I'd get more out of it with the right drugs.

The woman on the cover lives in my neighborhood. I met her once years ago.  There is a mural of her down the street on the side of a record store and she popped in to say "hi" and chat with the owner.

17855435711302039
Not sure why I picked this one to highlight, after years I'm still trying to figure out if I even actually LIKE this album.  Maybe that's it, I'm in a bit of a contrary mood so some dark trip hop works. (And actually it's easy to study to. Blue Lines and Protection are more danceable).
